# carrotwaxr's Stash Plugins

This repository holds plugins for extending the functionality of [Stash](https://github.com/stashapp/stash) adult media manager.

## Installation

In Stash, go to Settings >> Plugins and click the **Add Source** button under **Available Plugins**. Give it a _Name_ (like `carrotwaxr (stable)`) and add the _Source URL_ `https://carrotwaxr.github.io/stash-plugins/stable/index.yml`. _Local Path_ is optional but recommended to prevent potential naming conflicts with plugins from other repositories. A meaningful unique name like `carrotwaxr` is good.

## Configuration

You can find details about the usage and configuration of each plugin in the README in its directory here. Most plugins will require a `settings.ini` file be configured. In order to prevent your configuration getting updated on every update, a file is provided named `settings_example.ini` that can be referenced and/or renamed when initially creating your `settings.ini`.
