# GENERAL SETTINGS
# ============================================================================

# Dry run mode - when true, logs what would happen without making changes
# RECOMMENDED: Start with dry_run = true to preview changes safely
dry_run = true

# Enable the Scene.Update.Post hook (processes scenes when you update them)
enable_hook = true

# ============================================================================
# FILE RENAMER SETTINGS
# ============================================================================

# Enable the file renamer (moves/renames video files based on template)
enable_renamer = true

# Base path where renamed files will be organized
# This should be a directory within one of your Stash library paths
renamer_path = /data/tagged/

# Skip renaming files that are already in the renamer_path directory
renamer_ignore_files_in_path = false

# Mark scenes as "Organized" in Stash after renaming
renamer_enable_mark_organized = true

# Maximum total filepath length (including directory and filename)
# Adjust based on your OS - see limits above
renamer_filepath_budget = 250

# How to handle scenes with multiple files (e.g., same scene in different resolutions)
# Options:
#   all          - Process all files, uses $Resolution to differentiate names
#                  If files have same resolution, adds (2), (3) suffix
#   primary_only - Only rename the primary (first) file, ignore others
#                  Use this if you only want the "best" version organized
#   skip         - Skip the entire scene if it has multiple files
#                  Use this for safety if you're unsure about duplicates
renamer_multi_file_mode = all

# Filename template using variables:
#   Scene-level: $Studio, $Studios, $Title, $ReleaseDate, $ReleaseYear, $StashID
#   Scene-level: $Performers, $FemalePerformers, $MalePerformers, $Tags
#   File-level:  $Resolution (720p, 1080p, 4K, etc.), $Quality (SD, HD, FHD, UHD, etc.)
#
# Template must include enough variables to ensure uniqueness. Valid combinations:
#   - $StashID (always unique)
#   - $Studio + $Title + $ReleaseDate
#   - $Studios + $Title + $ReleaseDate
